## 3D Application (Processing)  

> Processing (programming language)
> Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks. The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming through the instant gratification of visual feedback. The language builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified syntax and graphics programming model. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel Shiffman, who formally joined as a third project lead.

We wont go in depth into programming with Processing. This here are just some notes on how to export usable 3D data for our purpose. For this we have this simple 3D scene that will create a OBJ file you can use in 123DMake and Paperkura. First you need to install the [OBJExport](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/tools/obj/) library from [Nervous System](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/index.php). There is a guide on the Processing Wiki on [how to install libraries manually](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library#manual-install). If this worked you can open the Processing IDE, paste the sketch blow into the window and run the sketch. This will create simple scene with a cube and plane and will create the output.obj file next to your Processing sketch. This data can be edited in [Blender](#3d-application-\(blender\))
