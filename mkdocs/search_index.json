            "text": "About Blender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlender is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games. Blender\ns features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, camera tracking, rendering, video editing and compositing. Alongside the modeling features it also has an integrated game engine.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n.  \n\n\n\n\nWe use \nBlender\n because it is a powerful open source, free of charge 3D application. It has a broad user base and a excellent \nreference.\n If you are already familiar with Blender, or know other 3D applications like Maya, C4D, Rhino, 3ds Max, or or or, you can skip this part and move on to the \nSlicer section\n or export your plans directly from within Blender using the \nPaper Model Add-on\n.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nYou should use a 3 button mouse if you are using a laptop. It makes the handling of Blender way easier.  \n\n\n\n\n(UI) Shortcuts\n\n\nBlender relies heavily on shortcuts. See an overview of all shortcuts here \nwaldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper/#Blender\n. Some shortcuts depend on the position of the mouse e.g. \nx\n for deleting only works when the mouse is over the 3D view.  \n\n\n(UI) Search Menu\n\n\nAnother quick way to call actions or open panels is the \nSearch Menu\n. It gives you quick access to all of Blenders commands by typing. you can open it just by hitting the \nspace bar\n. This is pretty handy if you know a commands name but don\nt know where to find it. Read more \nhere.\n\n\n(UI) Customize\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe interface is highly customizable in Blender. We will only adjust some minor settings to make it more user friendly.  \n\n\n\n\nGo to: \nFile \n User Preferences\u2026\n and select the \nInput\n tab.  \n\n\n\n\nChange the Mouse selection from right click to left click in the settings \n input tab\n\n\nEmulate Numpad\n (if you\nre on a laptop you can use the numbers instead of the numpad)\n\n\nAdjust UI colors in the theme tab (if you like it more fancy)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nYou need to hit \nSave User Settings\n at the bottom of the window to apply these changes. \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nYou can add or remove windows by right clicking into the \nseam\n between two windows. This allows you to add new windows or join existing ones. When adding you can toggle a horizontal or vertical split by pressing the middle mouse button This will be indicated by the dashed line that appears on the window you are trying to split. You can do the same by clicking and dragging the striped corner of a window to the left or down. To remove those windows just join them again. (See the animation below.)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight click window seam\n\n\nsplit/join windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight click window seam select split + middle mouse\n\n\ntoggle horizontal/vertical split\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick + drag striped corner down/up\n\n\nsplit horizontally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick + drag striped corner left/right\n\n\nsplit vertically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the content of a window by using the dropdown menu under the icon in the header (which is at the bottom of the 3D view).  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(UI) View Region\n\n\nWithin the 3D view you also have a tool bar on the left and the tool shelf on the right. \nt\n shows tool bar and \nn\n the tool shelf. On the toolbar you have the most common commands for transformation, editing, creation and many more organized as tabs. On the tool shelf you can access commonly used properties for transformations, the view, the 3D cursor and others organized as expandable panels. Both of these regions are kind of quick access palettes for properties and action that are essential for editing.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(UI) Viewport Shading\n\n\nThere are several shading methods available. You can see your model as:  \n\n\n\n\nBounding Box\n\n\nWireframe\n\n\nSolid\n\n\nTexture\n\n\nMaterial\n\n\nRendered\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch the shading method on the bottom of the 3D view. For us the only important options are \nSolid\n, \nWireframe\n and \nBounding Box\n. Read more about this \nin the docs.\n\n\n  \n\n\n(UI) View Navigation\n\n\nThe basic navigation in the 3D view is done with the mouse. You can also change the view by using the numpad.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleft mouse\n\n\nselect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nright mouse\n\n\nset 3D cursor position\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmiddle mouse click\n\n\norbit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmiddle mouse click + \u21e7\n\n\npan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscroll\n\n\nzoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe most useful keys on the numpad are (table also has emulated numpad)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Combo (emulated)\n\n\nView Change\n\n\nKey Combo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nFront\n\n\nNumpad 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 1\n\n\nBack\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nRight\n\n\nNumpad 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 3\n\n\nLeft\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nTop\n\n\nNumpad 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 7\n\n\nBottom\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nToggle orthographic vs perspective mode\n\n\nNumpad 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nCamera View\n\n\nNumpad 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot so important keys\n\n\nNumpad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nOrbit Left\n\n\nNumpad 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 4\n\n\nPan Left\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nOrbit Right\n\n\nNumpad 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 6\n\n\nPan Right\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nOrbit Up\n\n\nNumpad 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 8\n\n\nPan Up\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nOribit Down\n\n\nNumpad 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^ + 2\n\n\nPan Down\n\n\nNumpad ^ + 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\nZoom Out\n\n\nNumpad -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom In (seems not to work)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(UI) Cursor\n\n\nThe 3D cursor is a pivot point for various features. You can e.g. rotate objects around the cursor (see image below). Newly created objects get created at this position. You can also use the cursor to snap objects to it or the other way around.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey/Action\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nright click\n\n\nset 3D cursor position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u21e7 + c\n\n\nreset 3D cursor to the centre of the scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u21e7 + s\n\n\nopen snap menu (snap to cursor and so on)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Modeling) Modes\n\n\nThe \nObject Mode\n is for working with objects in a whole and editing your scene. You can add objects, cameras lamps and others in this mode. The \nEdit Mode\n is for editing the vertices, edges or faces of an object. When using \nmodifiers\n you see their effect in object mode, \nnot in Edit Mode\n. You can switch between Object and Edit mode just by hitting \n\u21e5\n when your mouse is ove the 3D viewport. There are more modes available. \nReadmore in the docs.\n\n\n(Modeling) Add \n Delete\n\n\nOn the tool bar on the left of the 3D view you have various possibilities to add objects.\nUse the Create tab an the left to add basic shapes. You can also use the hotkey \n\u21e7 + a\n or use the \nAdd\n menu at the bottom of the 3D view. When you create a new shape you get a new panel at the bottom of the toolbar. it is called the operator panel. There you can set additional settings for the newly created shape e.g. the subdivision of a ICO Sphere or the depth and the radius of a cylinder ad so on. \nThis is only possible on creation of the shape.\n If the operator panel does not show up just hit \nF6\n to show it as a floating panel.\n\nTo delete the selection hit \nx\n this applies for Edit- and Object Mode. In Edit Mode you get an additional panel to decide what should be deleted e.g. Vertices, edges, faces and even more options like edge collapse and more. You need to play with it and \nread in the manual\n about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey/Action\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToolbar Left\n\n\nadd different type of objects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Menu\n\n\nadd different type of objects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u21e7 + a\n\n\nopen \nAdd\n floating panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF6\n\n\nopen \nOperator\n floating panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\ndelete selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Modeling) Making Selections\n\n\nTo select objects use the left mouse click (if set to left selection. The default is right selection). You can add or remove objects to or from the selection by holding \n\u21e7\n. Selected objects are highlighted in orange (default theme). The first in the order of selected objects is a bit brighter. You can also select everything by hitting \na\n. In \nEdit Mode\n there are some extra options for selecting things. You can switch between vertices, edges and faces selection and you can combine them with the buttons on the bar below the 3D view. \nTher are also other selection modes. The rectangular (key \nr\n ) or circular (key \nc\n) selection allows to select  by clicking and dragging. This only applies to the visible objects, vertices, edges and faces. You can change this behavior if you want to selection to apply to non visible objects as well. There are even more options for selecting. Like Inverting selections and so on.

Change between grab, rotate and scale mode on the bottom of the 3D view. You can combine them or shut them off totally. If you click and drag into the circle at the centre of the manipulator you transform on all axis at once.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Modeling) Transformation Using Hotkeys\n\n\nSometimes it is more convenient to use the hotkeys. When using the hotkeys you can easily constrain the manipulation to an axis. Just hit for example \ng + x\n to only move the selection on the global x-axis. If you hit \nx\n twice you transform on the objects local axis. The second transformation corresponds with the pull down next to the manipulator buttons on the button of the view. Read some more about the manipulators \nhere\n.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nmanipulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\nrotate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr + x/y/z\n\n\nrotate on one axis only (global)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr + x/y/z \u00d7 2\n\n\nrotate on one axis only (selected axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng\n\n\ntransform (grab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng + x/y/z\n\n\ntransform (grab) on one axis only (global)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng + x/y/z \u00d7 2\n\n\ntransform (grab) on one axis only (selected axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\nscale\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns  + x/y/z\n\n\nscale on one axis only (global)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns  + x/y/z \u00d7 2\n\n\nscale on one axis only  (selected axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt + g\n\n\nsnaps selection to the center of the scene (Object Mode only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n(Modeling) Mesh Manipulation\n\n\nBesides just adding primitive shapes on one another you can also edit the mesh directly. To do this\nGo to Edit Mode by hitting the \n\u21e5\n key (TAB). As mentioned in the \n(Modeling Making Selections)\n section you can select in different ways. Vertices only, faces or edges or combine these options. You can now move the selection around. To manipulate your mesh even further you can copy and paste your selection. (\n\u2318  + c\n \n \n\u2318 + v\n). Additionally you can use several options on the toolbar to edit your mesh. Each option has its own operators.   \n\n\n(Modeling) Extrude\n\n\nExtrudes the current selection. \nAll Transformation\n and \nSelection\n options apply. You can basically differentiate between \nextrude region\n (hit \ne\n or use the button on the toolbar) and \nextrude individual\n. The region extrudes the selection together. The individual extrusion uses each local axis to extrude. See \nthe manual for further information.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey/Action\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\nExtrude Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2325 + e\n\n\nExtrude Individual\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Modeling) Separate\n\n\nYou might come to the point where you need to separate an object in multiple ones. There is an easy short cut for that. Go into Edit Mode (hit \u21e5) and select the faces or vertices you want in an new object and hit \np\n. You will be presented with a dialog that allows you to split by:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey/Action\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\nbrings up the separate menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit Type\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected\n\n\nThis option separates the selection to a new object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Loose Parts\n\n\nSeparates the mesh in its unconnected parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Material\n\n\nCreates separate mesh objects for each material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more \nhere.\n  \n\n\n(Modeling) Join\n\n\nTo join selected objects into one single object you can select them all. in \nj\n. Be aware that they will all be joined into the last selected object. You can see it in the difference in the highlight color.

Subdivide, Loop Cut and Slide or the Knife to name just a few. Subdivide for example divides the surface a defined number of times and gives some more options, like smoothness and fractal noise. Loop Cut and Slide allows to subdivide a selection as well by setting a position to cut in by dragging the mouse. the Knife does what it says. Allows to cut the mesh.  \n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nYou will see extra information on some tools on the bottom bar of the 3D view. The Knife for example needs to be confirmed by hitting \u21a9 (RETURN). Explore the tools by playing with them.  \n\n\n\n\nUsing Modifiers\n\n\nSome modifications can be tedious when done by hand. Fortunately lots of operations have already been pre defined as modifiers. You can access them on the \nProperties\n window under the little wrench. All modifiers first only affect the selected object. If you want to generate real mesh from them you need to apply them. Also be aware that modifiers work in stack. The order of them define their outcome. You can move them in the stack order by using the up and down arrows on each modifier. We will take a look at some of them that might be useful for our purpose. When you export your form for exchange with the forthcoming applications you don\nt need to apply these modifiers. An export to Wavefront obj will add all these vertices to the mesh.

The difference between view and render should be clear. View is what we see in the 3D view. Render is what will be used in the final render. For our purpose the only thing we need to be concerned about is the view setting. This is what will be exported into our exchange formats. You can also switch between a \nSimple\n and \nCatmull-Clark\n. To see the result before applying you need to switch the shading type to Wireframe. You can read more about this modifier \nhere.\n  \n\n\n\n\nCatmull-Clark\n\nThe default option, subdivides and smooths the surfaces. According to \nits Wikipedia page\n, the \u201carbitrary-looking formula was chosen by Catmull and Clark based on the aesthetic appearance of the resulting surfaces rather than on a mathematical derivation.  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n(Modifiers) Boolean\n\n\nThe \nBoolean Modifier\n can be used to create intersection between two objects. When you first apply it you wont see any change. You need to select another object in your scene to be used as the mesh object for the operation. Then you have 3 different methods to apply the modifier.

You can offset the copies on the 3 axis relative or constantly. You can use an objects transformation to define the offset as well. There are some more options for this modifier. It can be pretty powerful to create multiple copies of an object. Read more \nhere.\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Modifiers) Subdivide and Displace\n\n\nTo show you what can be done by combining several modifiers the following animation shows how to use the \nSubdivision Surface\n and \nDisplace\n modifiers together. The subdivision is done to create more vertices and the displacement to generate some offset on them. The displace modifier uses textures to offset the vertices. You could also use an image or a ramp to displace the vertices. Be creative. This is already rather complex for the starters. Use it as inspiration. There are many more modifiers. To much to explore them all here. Play with some/all of them.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAdd-ons\n\n\nAdditionally to the many build in features of Blender there is a whole ecosystem of \nAdd-ons\n. There are several Add-ons that are directly distributed with Blender but bot enabled by default. You can browse them in the user preferences an enable those that you like to use. You can also install Add-ons from file. These are Python scripts that are written by members of the community. For our project there are two Add-ons we need to download and install.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nExport: Paper Model (.svg) | Export printable net for paper modeling\n  \n\n\nAutodesk DXF (.dxf) | Export geometry to .DXF file format.\n  \n\n\n\n\n(Add-on) Paper Model\n\n\nBoth are pretty self-explanatory. The Paper Model Add-on adds under File \n Export \n Paper Model (.svg) the possibility to export a unfolded vector graphic of the selected object. In the export panel ae on the lower left side some export options for the graphic. You can specify the page size, add margins, create tabs for gluing your model and some more options but the default options are pretty good. If the export fails try to scale your model down or increase the size. We will adjust the plans size later on in a vector editor. Read some more about this Add-on \nhere.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n(Add-on) DXF export\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nThe DXF export Add-on might be useful when working with \ndxf2papercraft\n.\n\n\n\n\nExport\n\n\nTo export our data we can use different options. For one we can use the Paper Model Add-on]. Then we have a vector graphic we just have to clean up and convert to \nDXF\n to use it for laser cutting. If this is your chosen workflow, move on to \nCreating Clean Plans\n. If you want to use Slicer or Paperkura you need to use an interchange format like \nSTL\n or \nOBJ\n. You don\nt need to specify a final scaling. Slicer and Paperkura both allow to edit the scaling of the Model and the material/paper size.  \n\n\n(Export) STL STereoLithography\n\n\nIf you use STL you need to use the ascii format and apply all modifiers when used. It would be better that you don\nt apply the modifiers from within the Add-on. As already mentioned the modifiers depend on their stack, so applying them by hand gives you a better control over the outcome.  \n\n\n(Export) OBJ Wavefront\n\n\nYou can also use the \nWavefront OBJ\n format. It has some more options for the export then the STL but creates a equivalent result. You also should apply the modifiers first as mentioned for the \nSTL\n export.",

This applicaiton allows creation of low-tech LOM-style (Laminated object manufacturing) solid models. The application has several construction techniques for now we will only focus on creating \nFolded Panels\n.  \n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nThe default unit is inch\n. This cannot be set globally you will need to adjust this for each panel where you use units.\n\n\nOn a German localized computer \nthe application accepts as decimal point the comma when entering values by typing \n- even though the numbers are displayed with a dot  \n\n\nPasting into fields wont work\n. Use the Right Mouse Button and paste from the pop up menu.  \n\n\nSplitting the panels can save you a lot of material\n.  \n\n\nOn Mac OSX you can \nextract the Help PDF by opening the application package\n. In there you\nll find the PDF under /Applications/SlicerForFusion360.app/Contents/\n    Resources/LargeFormatSlicerHelp.pdf\n\n\nYou need an Autodesk account\n for exporting your plans.\n\n\nDon\nt perforate your plan\n. The marks for the folding lines are enough to. We will cut them with different settings leaving a visual mark where to fold your material.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject and Material Settings\n\n\nWhen you import your 3D model you first need to set some options. The manufacturing settings allow you to set the size of your material. This can be set to a fairly huge size (the laser cutter at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany) has a size of 1200 mm to 900 mm). You can set the \nObject Size\n when you need a defined size. Another way is adjusting the size based on your material size. if your desired object size exceeds you material size the application will allow you to export several cut sheets.\n\nWhat\ns more important is to set the \nThickness\n of your material. This will determine how narrow/wide the holes for tongues and tabs are we are going to produce later on. There is also another setting we need to take in account. The \nSlot Offset\n. This is the amount of material the laser will take away. For cutting grey cardboard around 0.5 to 1.5 mm you can set this to \n=1 mm. You can set all of these settings by pressing the little wrench and then adjusting them on the bottom of the application window. You also can save some presets for your material.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhen you done with setting up your material choose from the Construction Techniques \nFolded Panels\n.  \n\n\nFolded Panels\n\n\n\n\nSeparates your 3D model into 2D segments of triangular meshes. These segments (panels) are folded multiple times, then attached using one of ten different joint types. Use paper, cardboard, even sheet metal.\n\n- From Slicer Help (within Application)  \n\n\n\n\n(Folded Panels) Optimize Panels/Add Remove Seams\n\n\nIf you still want to edit your model you can adjust the count of vertices in these panels or add new seams to your object. You can also split all panels for the final cut plan.  \n\n\n(Folded Panels) Joint Types\n\n\nHere you can select how you want to connect your unfolded object after production.

The dark areas of the image need to be cut out. Change Tooth Radius to set the distance from the edge of the sheet for the cutouts. Change Tick Spacing  to set the spacing between the cutouts. Change Tooth Scale  to set the height of the teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaced\n\n\nConnect joints by lacing sheets together. Change Hole Radius to make the holes bigger. Change Joint Space to set the spacing between rivets used to connect the joints. Change Tick Radius to set the distance of the rivet holes from the edge of the sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultitab\n\n\nConnect joint by fixing ticks together. Change Tick Radius to change the height of the ticks. Change Tab Fraction to change the width of the ticks (tabs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPuzzle\n\n\nConnect joint by fitting pieces together. Change Tick Radius to change the height of the ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRivet\n\n\nConnect joint by riveting ticks to one another. Change Hole Radius to make the holes bigger. Change Joint Space to increase or decrease the number of rivets used to connect the joints. Change Tick Radius to set the distance of the rivet holes from the edge of the sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeam\n\n\nConnect joints by sewing them together (like a sewing pattern). Change the Seam Radius to change the width of the seam\u2019s panel border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTab\n\n\nConnect joints by inserting a tick into slots. Change the Tick Radius to change the width and length of the slots and ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicked\n\n\nConnect joints by connecting the ticks along the seams Change Tick Space to make the ticks closer to one another or further apart.

The \nTab Joints\n are set to have a \nTick Radius\n of 10 mm (set it at the bottom of the window). The second one has the same settings but with \nSplit Panels\n enabled.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Folded Panels) Joint Type Tongue\n\n\nThe \nTongue\n type is similar to the tab type. We used here the same settings. \n The size of the cube is 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 20 mm on a sheet with the size of 700 mm \u00d7 1000 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm.

We won\nt go into them for now.   \n\n\n\n\nStacked Slices\n  \n\n\n\n\nCross sections your 3D model, cutting it into slices you can glue and stack on top of one another. Use the Dowels option to make it easier to line up and assemble your model. You can recreate the model using any flat material you can cut.\n\n- From Slicer Help (within Application)  \n\n\n\n\nInterlocked Slices\n  \n\n\n\n\nCuts your 3D model into two stacks of slotted slices. Lock them together in a grid, like when building a 3D puzzle. This uses less material than stacked slices.\n\n- From Slicer Help (within Application)  \n\n\n\n\nCurve\n  \n\n\n\n\nCuts slices perpendicular to a curve, resembling ribs. Use this for organic shapes, such as for modelling a brontosaurus. Also, use the Navigation tools to help rotate your view to see the \ncurve.\n\n- From Slicer Help (within Application)  \n\n\n\n\nRadial Slices\n  \n\n\n\n\nCuts your 3D model into radiating slices from a central point.  Use this for a round symmetrical object, such as a vase.\n\n- From Slicer Help (within Application)  \n\n\n\n\nSlices 3D\n  \n\n\n\n\nCross sections your 3D model, similar to Stacked Slices.

Both can be edited in vector editors. For the best result we need to clean up the data a bit more. We will use Adobe Illustrator (Mac, Win) for this.  \n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nIf you don\nt have a license for Illustrator you can also use Inkscape (Cross Platform) or Affinity Designer (Mac).  \n\n\n\n\nUsing Adobe Illustrator\n\n\nOpen your svg or eps, set the units of the document to millimeters (\u2318 + \u21e7 + p) and set your artboard size to match the size of your material (can be accessed through the Artboard tool or directly from the document settings). To see what the laser will use you should take a look at the \nPath View\n. You can switch back and forth between the visual view and the path view by hitting \u2318 + y on your keyboard. \n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nUsing the path view is often much simpler.\n This is what the Sabeko laser software sees.   \n\n\nOne color per \nlaser cut layer\n.\n Different colors produce separated layers in the Sabeko laser software.  \n\n\nYou can \nselect objects by color\n using the selection menu.  \n\n\nCreate additional marks for folding and assembly.\n For additional information on your cut plan you can use the \nMonoline Text Drawing Script.\n  \n\n\nDashed lines are not really dashed.\n To create real dashed single line paths use \nthis trick\n from the Adobe forums.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans from Slicer\n\n\nIf you used Slicer you have the some numbers on the plan and, if not splitted into panels, also some folding marks. We can engrave those with low power setting to have some visual hints where to fold our model. To do so you need to give them a different color then the outer form which should be cutted. The laser cutter application will detect colors and allow us to apply quickly different settings. Release all groups and compound paths if needed. Sort them by color. Remove all unwanted information.\n\nOne important step is to remove the most outer path (it is a rectangle). This is an outer bound created when exporting the .eps file. If we don\nt do this it will be cutted by the laser.

It is easier export it to something like a A3 paper size and then rescale the model to fit your needs.

To see what the laser will use you should take a look at the  Path View . You can switch back and forth between the visual view and the path view by hitting \u2318 + y on your keyboard.    Hint   Using the path view is often much simpler.  This is what the Sabeko laser software sees.     One color per  laser cut layer .  Different colors produce separated layers in the Sabeko laser software.    You can  select objects by color  using the selection menu.    Create additional marks for folding and assembly.  For additional information on your cut plan you can use the  Monoline Text Drawing Script.     Dashed lines are not really dashed.  To create real dashed single line paths use  this trick  from the Adobe forums.",

We can engrave those with low power setting to have some visual hints where to fold our model. To do so you need to give them a different color then the outer form which should be cutted. The laser cutter application will detect colors and allow us to apply quickly different settings. Release all groups and compound paths if needed. Sort them by color. Remove all unwanted information. \nOne important step is to remove the most outer path (it is a rectangle). This is an outer bound created when exporting the .eps file. If we don t do this it will be cutted by the laser. Your final plans should look like the pictures below.
