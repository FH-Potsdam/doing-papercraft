# 123DMake

When you are done with creating a simple 3D object either by using [Blender]({{blender.html | prepend: site.basurl}}) or with [Processing]({{processing.org.html | prepend: site.baseurl}}) you can move on to [Autodesks 123DMake](http://www.123dapp.com/make). Allows creation of low-tech LOM-style (Laminated object manufacturing) solid models. The application has several construction techniques.  

### Stacked Slices  

> Cross sections your 3D model, cutting it into slices you can glue and stack on top of one another. Use the Dowels option to make it easier to line up and assemble your model. You can recreate the model using any flat material you can cut.  
> - From 123DMake Help (within Application)  

### Interlocked Slices

> Cuts your 3D model into two stacks of slotted slices. Lock them together in a grid, like when building a 3D puzzle. This uses less material than stacked slices.  
> - From 123DMake Help (within Application)  


### Curve  

>Cuts slices perpendicular to a curve, resembling ribs. Use this for organic shapes, such as for modeling a brontosaurus. Also, use the Navigation tools to help rotate your view to see the 
curve.

### Radial Slices  

>Cuts your 3D model into radiating slices from a central point.  Use this for a round symmetrical object, such as a vase.

### Folded Panels   

> Separates your 3D model into 2D segments of triangular meshes. These segments (panels) are folded multiple times, then attached using one of ten different joint types. Use paper, cardboard, even sheet metal.  
> - From 123DMake Help (within Application)  

This goes into depth.  


### 3D Slices
>Cross sections your 3D model, similar to Stacked Slices. Rather than a stepped section for each slice, the section conforms to the surface of the 3D model.
