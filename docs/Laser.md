### Laser On  

- Open the upper window for the ventilation.
- Switch on the master switch on the backside. 
- Check if there is no material within the cutting area. 
- Check if there is enough room between the distance pushbutton, the laser head and the table.
- Put the keys into the according holes.  
- Is the security switch up?  

!!!warning
    The laser does a reference run into the upper right corner. If there is any material in the way you could damage the laser head.   

### Setup the Focus

- Put your material on he table blow the distance head
- On the control panel push __"Z/U"__
- Go to __"Autofocus"__.
- One hand over the security switch.
- confirm the autofocus with __"Enter"__.

!!!warning
    If the material is not under the blue distance switch you can damage the laser head.  

### Cutting

- Minimum and maximum power should be on the same value.
- Check if your vectors are closed. 
- You can simulate the cut in the software on the upper right corner with the little screen icon.
- You can simulate your cut with the laser if you don't switch on the actually laser. This is not done by the software. It needs to be enabled manually.
- Use the __"origin"__ button on the control panel to set your 0/0 point where the cut should start.
- Close the coverage.
- Turn the upper key to switch on the laser.
- Hit the __"confirm"__ button
- Start the cut from the software.  

### Engraving

- Max resolution is 1000ppi
- JPG/PNG files get converted to greyscale
- BMP is also possible
- closed vector forms can also be engraved

!!!hint
    The software uses greyscale/raster images for engraving. The minimum and maximum greyscale gets mapped onto the power of the laser.



### Materials  

This is a list of already tested materials for cutting. You always should have some spare material for adjusting the power settings of laser.
