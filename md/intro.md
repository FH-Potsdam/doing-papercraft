## Introduction  

This document is a write-down for a workshop @ the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany) as part of the seminar ["Datenobjekte"](https://incom.org/workspace/6569) (data objects) by [Professor Boris Müller](https://incom.org/profil/99) (a.k.a [@borism](https://twitter.com/borism) on Twitter). We will explore the minimal basics of the 3D application Blender to create primitive shapes which will then be unfolded for laser cutting. _This is still work in progress, there might be_ 🐛_,_ 🐉 _and_ 👾_._  

This document is split into several sub pages for an easier overview.
